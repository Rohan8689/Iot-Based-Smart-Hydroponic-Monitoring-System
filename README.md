# Iot-Based-Smart-Hydroponic-Monitoring-System
Hydroponics is a soil-less cultivation method where plants grow in nutrient-rich water solutions.
To optimize plant growth, itâ€™s crucial to monitor various parameters such as pH, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels.
IoT-enabled systems utilize sensors to collect real-time data on these factors. Here are some key aspects of IoT-based hydroponic monitoring systems

Sensor Networks
These systems employ wireless sensor networks to monitor essential parameters.
Sensor nodes are strategically placed within the hydroponic setup.
The main node coordinates communication with other nodes.

Parameter Monitoring
Sensors continuously measure critical factors
pH Maintaining the correct pH level is essential for nutrient absorption.
Temperature Optimal temperature ensures plant health.
Humidity Proper humidity levels prevent stress and disease.
Nutrient Levels Monitoring nutrient concentrations helps adjust the solution.
Light Intensity Some systems also monitor light exposure.

Data Transmission
Sensor nodes transmit data wirelessly to a central hub.
The main node aggregates data from all sensors.
Real-time data is crucial for timely adjustments.

Remote Monitoring and Control
Greenhouse keepers can access data remotely via a website or mobile app.
Alerts can be set up for abnormal conditions.
Remote control features allow adjustments .
